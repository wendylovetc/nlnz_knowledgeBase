+ set-up the working environment on desktop - mostly done

  + local admin account works on desktop but not laptop, no fix yet, considering swapping the laptop for a more common model (with better screen).

+ examine WoD archive

  + missing length attribute for all records in CDX files except for 2008 and 2015.
  + this information could be helpful for identifying and estimating duplicated records in the entire archive.
  + did a few experiments and found duplication does exist in the archive.
  + using `www.vod.livestream.com` domain as an example to estimate the duplication level.

+ Have we decided the new team name? How about "Digital Preservation and Data Insight"?

+ Marginalia Similar Website Finder (e.g., https://explore2.marginalia.nu/search?domain=niwa.co.nz) - maybe an useful idea for WoD fuzz search?
